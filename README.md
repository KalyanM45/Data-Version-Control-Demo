# Data-Version-Control-Demo

Data Version Control (DVC) is an open-source tool designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners manage large datasets, track changes to data files, and maintain reproducibility in their projects. DVC operates as an extension to Git, integrating seamlessly with existing version control systems to efficiently handle the versioning of data and models. 

The provided demo project demonstrates the practical implementation and advantages of using DVC. It showcases how DVC simplifies data versioning and model versioning while working in tandem with Git to create a cohesive version control system tailored for data science projects. Emphasizing the significance of preserving data version history for reproducibility, the demo also highlights DVC's ability to handle large datasets within a Git repository effectively.
